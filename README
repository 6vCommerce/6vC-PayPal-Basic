INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Prerequisites

- Used to require NA-shop module, but this should no longer be necessary.  However, I have never tried
  using this module on it's own.  If you run into problems, please post questions on support thread (see
  info above).

2. Copy Files

Copy all files to their equivalent directories in your eshop install.  If you're already using
your own custom theme, theme changes will have to be merged manually one way or the other (ie. merge
v6c_azure into your custom theme folder or vice-versa).

3. ADMIN/BACKEND Settings

- If you haven't already done so, clear the tmp directory or the following settings will not be accessible.
- Press Install/Update button under 6vC Modules>Merchant Link then press the update db views button under Service>Tools.
- Master Settings>Core Settings>Settings>Administration>Folders in Order Administration:  Append the following line: V6C_ORDERFOLDER_PENDING => #AAAAAA
- 6vC Modules>Merchant Links>Main>Enter email associated with PayPal account (from PayPal>My Account>Profile>Email).
- 6vC Modules>Merchant Links>Main>Enter PayPal merchant account ID (from PayPal>My Account: Profile Summary).
- 6vC Modules>Merchant Links>Main>Check the "Process PDT transactions over SSL" option.  (PDT used to support non-SSL confirmation but it doesn't work anymore so you MUST check this option!)
- Shop Settings>Payment Methods> Activate PayPal method and configure accordingly (assign user groups & countries, assign to shipping methods, etc.).

4. PayPal Settings

- If not already done, sign up for a (free) Website Payments Standard business account.
- My Account>Profile>Instant Payment Notification Preferences: Enable IPN messages AND set URL to http://www.yourwebsite.com/index.php?cl=v6c_hPayPalIpn&v6c_gateway=paypal
NVP:
1. (My) Profile > My Selling Tools > Selling online > API access > select update link
2. Select "Request API credentials" (Option 2)
3. Select "Request API signature" then hit Agree and Submit button
4. Copy information (Username, Password, Signature) to appropriate fields under Admin > 6vC Modules > Merchant Links


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use of this module results in the following changes to standard OXID eShop behaviour.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Basket expiration (config parameter 'blPsBasketReservationEnabled') is no longer supported.
  Information pertaining to this config option is stored only in the session and is therefore
  not available to the remote merchant web service when an order is completed.  To support this
  feature a method of storing/restoring all required information to/from the db would be required.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEVELOPERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Please note that there's a bunch of code in this release that is no longer applicable/supported.
  The code used to support linking to a merchant gateway at the end of checkout (user would complete
  order on merchant gateway site).  This code proved way too complex and a nasty maintenance issue.
  Until all this old code is cleaned out, you will find comments that suggest a file or function is
  obsolete or no longer needed.  Sorry for the mess.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Disconintue support for merchant gateways linked to order page (gateways that don't return to website
  after completion of order).
