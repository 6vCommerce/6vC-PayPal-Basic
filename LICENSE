This package is separated into two parts that fall under two different licenses as explained below.

1. 6vCommerce MerchantLink Module

	Consists of the actual module (several files under the 'modules' directory).  Unless otherwise noted,
	files are licensed under the Common Public Attribution License 1.0 (CPAL).  For details, see the CPAL file.

2. 6vCommerce MerchantLink Module Support Package

	Consists of all other files (mostly files outside of the 'modules' directory) and is licensed under
	the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 (GPLv3).  For details, see the GPL file.

In simple plain english, the CPAL requires any user of the code (not just distributors) to modestly credit the
author somewhere/anywhere one their website.  Other than that, you're free to use and modify the code as you feel fit.
Examples of acceptable ways to modestly credit the author are given below (for details, see Exhibit B at the end of
the CPAL file).  A nice explanation I found on the internet is also given below.

EXPLANATION:

"These conditions require a modest attribution to the author, who hopes that its promotional value may help
justify the time and effort invested in writing this and other freely available, open-source software."
